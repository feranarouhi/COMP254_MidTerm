# COMP254_MidTerm


Be sure to read the following general instructions carefully:
- This lab test must be completed individually by all the students.
- Read the project naming and submission guidelines on page 3.
- Create 30 seconds video to record your output from console. You donâ€™t need to explain
code in the video.
Question [10 Marks]
Create a student management system using a linked list data structure in Java. The system should
allow teachers to manage student records by performing operations such as adding students,
removing students, and displaying all student records. Implement the required functionality using
a linked list.
Your assignment should include the following components:
1. Student Class: Define a Java class named Student to represent a student in the system.
Each student should have attributes such as a unique student ID (id), a name (name), an
age (age), and a grade (grade). Include appropriate constructors and methods to access and
modify student attributes.
2. StudentLinkedList Class: Create a Java class named StudentLinkedList to encapsulate
the functionality of the student management system using a linked list. Implement methods
to add students to the list (addStudent), remove students by their unique student ID
(removeStudentById), display all student records (displayStudents), and any other
helper methods you deem necessary.
3. User Interface: Develop a simple console-based user interface to interact with the
StudentLinkedList class. Teachers should be able to add students, remove students, and
display all student records through a menu-driven interface.
4. Main Program: Write a main program that demonstrates the functionality of the
StudentLinkedList class. It should allow teachers to continuously interact with the student
management system until they choose to exit.
Your implementation should handle scenarios such as adding students with duplicate IDs,
removing students that do not exist, displaying an empty list of students, and gracefully handling
user input errors.
Ensure to write clean and well-documented code, including comments where necessary to explain
the functionality of each component.
